## 🌌 Overview

**MAP (Manifold Alignment Protocol)** is an architectural paradigm and interoperability standard designed to bridge the gap between high-dimensional black-box systems and human cognitive understanding.

In an era of emergent AI and complex physical systems, reductionism fails. MAP proposes a **Cybernetic** alternative: accepting the black box as is, and characterizing its behavior through **Geometric Dynamics**. By modeling processing states as trajectories on a Riemannian manifold, MAP provides a unified language to describe **Convergence**, **Stability**, and **Safety** across heterogeneous substrates—from LLMs to RF Signal Processors.

> **"The Map is not the Territory, but it is the Interface."**

## 🏗️ Protocol Architecture

MAP defines a standardized four-layer stack to decouple the mathematical kernel from the user interface. A system is considered "MAP-Compliant" if it exposes its state through this hierarchy:

| Layer | Name | Definition | Paradigm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L4** | **Interface** | The low-dimensional projection (Dashboard). | **Visual Metaphors**<br>(Funnels, Walls, Slopes) |
| **L3** | **Alignment** | The geometric structures of stability. | **Descriptive Geometry**<br>(Attractors, Basins, Curvature) |
| **L2** | **Dynamics** | The laws of motion governing state evolution. | **Flow Mechanics**<br>(Velocity, Drift, Diffusion) |
| **L1** | **Substrate** | The raw, high-dimensional reality. | **Terra Incognita**<br>(Weights, Voltages, Latents) |

## 📜 Standards & Specifications

The core definition of the protocol is maintained as an RFC-style technical specification. This document serves as the source of truth for the L1-L4 definitions and mathematical profiles.

## 🔧 Reference Implementations (The Ecosystem)

To demonstrate the universality of MAP, we provide official reference implementations across three distinct domains of complexity.

### 1. Cognitive Semantics (LLM)
**Project:** `MAP-LLM-Toolkit`
* **Domain:** Natural Language Processing / AI Safety
* **Role:** An L4-Interface implementation for visualizing reasoning convergence and safety topology in Llama/Qwen models.
* **Key Feature:** Visualizes the "Thinking Process" as a converging funnel.

### 2. Generative Latents (Diffusion)
**Project:** `MAP-ComfyUI`
* **Domain:** Generative AI / Image Synthesis
* **Role:** A real-time "Vector Network Analyzer" for Stable Diffusion.
* **Key Feature:** Uses **Q-Score (L3 Metric)** to auto-tune Steps and CFG, replacing guesswork with geometric optimization.

### 3. Physical Signals (SDR/RF)
**Project:** `GAGC (Geometric AGC)`
* **Domain:** Signal Processing / Radio Engineering
* **Role:** An embedded L2/L3 controller implementation.
* **Key Feature:** Uses **Discrete Curvature** to eliminate signal overshoot and identify noise floors without energy thresholds.

## ⚖️ Ethical Use & Safety

MAP is a framework for **Observability** and **Steerability**. It is designed to make black-box systems safer and more predictable. It is **not** intended for behavioral manipulation or bypassing AI safety guardrails.
