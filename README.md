## 🌌 Overview

**MAP (Manifold Alignment Protocol)** is a geometric standard for describing how heterogeneous cognitive systems—whether biological or artificial—converge toward shared conceptual structures. 

By modeling reasoning as potential-driven flows on high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, MAP provides a unified interface to visualize:
- **Cognitive Convergence:** How diverse prompts collapse into stable attractor wells.
- **Safety Topology:** The geometric distinction between "hard" refusal boundaries and "soft" adaptive guidance.
- **Cross-Domain Isomorphism:** A common language to translate between physics, AI dynamics, and cognitive science.

## 🧪 Key Findings

### 1. Geometric Convergence (The "Funnel" Effect)
Using prompt-annealing on open-weights LLMs (Llama-3, Qwen), we observe that reasoning trajectories naturally converge into shared attractor basins, validating the MAP convergence hypothesis.

### 2. Topological Safety Signatures
MAP reveals the hidden geometry of AI safety. **Rigid Mode** (hard refusal) creates sharp curvature spikes (collisions), while **Adaptive Mode** (guidance) maintains smooth geodesic flow.

## 🏗️ Architecture

MAP is designed as a four-layer protocol stack:
1.  **L1 Substrate:** Riemannian/Information Geometry (The Math).
2.  **L2 Dynamics:** Overdamped Langevin Diffusion (The Physics).
3.  **L3 Protocol:** Alignment primitives (Attractors, Barriers).
4.  **L4 Interface:** The cognitive UI metaphors (Wells, Slopes).

This decoupled architecture allows for **Self-Iterability**: the mathematical kernel can be upgraded without breaking the intuitive interface layer.

## ⚖️ Ethical Use & Safety

MAP is a theoretical framework for visualization and alignment analysis. It is **not** intended for behavioral manipulation or bypassing AI safety guardrails.
